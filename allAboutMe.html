    My relationship with books is a long and slightly comical one. I learned to read later than most peers. At the beginning of first grade, I was illiterate. I couldn’t read words. And yet, despite that, I still did well in school, mainly based on my high comprehension ability. I could tell the story just fine, but when the teacher pointed to a word, I couldn’t read it. It took a surprisingly long time for the teachers to catch on, and once they did, Mom bought the Oxford Reading Tree series. We’d read together, every day. And this effort paid off. During third grade, we took a Lexile reading  score test. I received 1324, the equivalent of a high-schooler. However, I wasn’t interested in the books at that level- they were all boring. And so, I delved into other stories. I had practically read the entire fiction section of the library at my school, but my favorite genre was always fantasy. I loved how you could immerse yourself into another world, a world where magic was real. And I also loved the characters- they were all so interesting, so funny. Reading about them… it was almost like being their friend. The difference was that they would never leave me.

    I’d finished the first four books of <i>Harry Potter</i> by the end of third grade. I’d finished the <i> Percy Jackson </i> series by fourth or fifth grade and had started on the 39 Clues. Also in that time period, I’d read through <i>Dragon Rider</i> by Cornelia Funke and finished the first book of the <i>Inkheart</i> series, though I didn’t finish the series. <i>Inkheart</i> was just too scary. Sometime in sixth grade, Mom introduced me to Kate DiCamillo, and I learned to love the <i>Hobbit</i> and the entire <i>Lord of the Rings</i> series. In those years, I also participated in my school’s Battle of the Books, placing first and second respectively in my fourth and fifth grades. In those years, I was always in the “advanced” class for reading. In sixth grade, Mom introduced me to <i>The Ranger’s Apprentice</i>, and I finished each book as soon as I could. By seventh grade, I’d finished Tamora Pierce’s <i>Alanna the Lioness</i> series, <i>Protector of the Small</i> series, and <i>Immortals</i> series. A strong part of my voracious appetite for books was probably my almost abnormally fast reading pace. I could finish each of the books in the <i>Percy Jackson and the Olympians</i> series within two hours, and even the thicker books in <i>the Kane Chronicles</i> barely occupied me for longer than an hour and a half. As a result, my reading times were sporadic, and I often re-read my books. Whenever I got a new book, it would be finished within two or three days. If my parents made me go to sleep… I pretended to sleep and hid my book whenever Mom or Dad checked in on me.

    In high school, however… things took the biggest change. It’s no longer me, my bed, my lamp, and my book. These days, it’s me, my chair, my desk, my five-or-so gel pens, my mechanical pencil, my eraser, my laptop, my writing pad, my lamp, and my book. In addition, I now tend to be less engaged in the story, because I now always read it from an objective standpoint. I pay attention to every character’s behavior, take note of the setting, and analyze the writing style. It almost makes the book… less engaging. But I have found that it isn’t always easy to snap free of the brainwashing. I tried re-reading some of the books in my collection, and while it was all too easy to note down the language, characters, and setting in my mind, it only took two books before I managed to enjoy the story just as I once did. Still, despite my new-found affection towards annotation, I don’t believe that habit will ever extend outside of my school books or the books I need to work from. I like keeping my books pristine and new-looking. The evidence of their age can be found not in hastily-scribbled notes in the margins, but in the slightly looser binding, and dog-eared pages. Ideas change, and viewpoints change. I have discovered that this year. When I go back to read over books, I do not want to be told how to think. I would rather re-discover the book first. Yes, it may prove entertaining to see how I thought before, but the story will always come first.
